==========

This is a small debugging and test tool for BefunGen. It's mostly used to yuickly access different features of BefunGen.

You could probably use this as an (crappy) example implementation


Download
========

You can download the binaries from my website [www.mikescher.de](http://www.mikescher.de/programs/view/BefunUtils)

Set Up
======

*This program was developed under Windows with Visual Studio.*

You need the other [BefunUtils](https://github.com/Mikescher/BefunUtils) projects to run this. And because this is for testing, the program alone would be without much use.  
Follow the setup instructions from BefunUtils: [README](https://github.com/Mikescher/BefunUtils/blob/master/README.md)
